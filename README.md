Welcome to the Survival's Gambit! This project is a fun and nostalgic take on the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game, infused with a Soviet Union-themed story. Can you battle Officer Raskalov to keep your life?

It was written using predominantly JavaScript as a exercise to build my JS skills and understanding/limitations of the DOM. 

Have fun!
