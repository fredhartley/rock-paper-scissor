        In the frosty grip of a Soviet winter, desperation and hunger clawed at the hearts of the people. 
        You, a humble soul driven by the instinct to protect your family, found yourself on the wrong side 
        of the law after stealing a single loaf of bread from the desolate bakery. The Soviet famine had 
        spared no one, and your family's survival depended on that stolen sustenance. <br><br>

        Enter the stage, a local corrupt police officer, a man who reveled in the misfortune of others. 
        He caught you red-handed, with the stolen bread as damning evidence. Instead of turning you in immediately, 
        he presented a sinister proposition. "Beat me at a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors, and 
        I'll turn a blind eye to your transgressions. Fail, and you and your family face the firing squad." <br><br>

        The chilling wind whipped through the desolate streets as you reluctantly agreed, knowing that the stakes were 
        life and death. The corrupt officer grinned, the icy glint in his eye reflecting the stark reality of your situation.
